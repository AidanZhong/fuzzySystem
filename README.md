# Fuzzy assignment1
we used juzzy python library to implement it.
You need to use anaconda environment to run the code.
Run Case1.py to test case 1 input.
Run Case2.py to test case 2 input.

Case 1 and Case 2 are based on the same system. And case2datatest.ipynb shows the tests for case 2 (interval inputs).

Case 1 -- Authored by Tang Lok Wong
Case 2 -- Authored by Qinkun Zhong
