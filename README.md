# Fuzzy assignment
we used juzzy python library to implement it.

# Running step
You could use anaconda environment to run the JuzzyPython code.

Run Case1.py and input patient's body data in singleton to test case 1 input.

Run Case2.py and input patient's body data in interval to test case 2 input.

Case 1 and Case 2 are based on the same system. And case2datatest.ipynb shows the tests for case 2 (interval inputs).

Case 1 -- Authored by Tang Lok Wong
Case 2 -- Authored by Qinkun Zhong
